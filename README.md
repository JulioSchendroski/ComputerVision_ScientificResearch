### Scientific Research about computer vision and artificial intelligence
    
    A study about computer vision and technologic features to indentify objetcs of interessed.
    That is a scientific research realized in IFSP  - Instituto Federal de SÃ£o Paulo, Piracicaba.

During this research, it was used programming languages as python, and packages that has tools to implemented computer visions techniques.

* Python - 3.8.8
* OpenCV - 4.5.2.54
* NumPy  - 1.21.4

For the recoginize objetcs and animals, has been used HAAR-CASACDE algorithm and datasets to identify heifers on the field, training the artificial intelligence with a GUI Trainer, to facilitate the progress.

The operational system used was Linux, specifically Debian 11 "Bullseye" distro.
